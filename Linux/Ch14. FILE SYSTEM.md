# File System

## Device Special Files (Devices)
A device special file corresponds to a device on the system.
Devices can be divided into two types:
- `Character devices` handle data on a character-by-character basis. Terminals and keyboards are examples of character devices.
- `Block devices` handle data a block at a time. Examples of block devices include disks and tape drives.

Device files are usually under the `/dev`, the superuser can create a device file using the `mknod` command.

### Device IDs
Each device file has a `major ID number` and a `minor ID number`. The major ID identifies the general class of device, and minor ID uniquely identifies a particular device within a general class.
