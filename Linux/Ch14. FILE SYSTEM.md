# File System

## Device Special Files (Devices)
A device special file corresponds to a device on the system.
Devices can be divided into two types:
- `Character devices` handle data on a character-by-character basis. Terminals and keyboards are examples of character devices.
- `Block devices` handle data a block at a time. Examples of block devices include disks and tape drives.

Device files are usually under the `/dev`, the superuser can create a device file using the `mknod` command.

### Device IDs
Each device file has a `major ID number` and a `minor ID number`. The major ID identifies the general class of device, and minor ID uniquely identifies a particular device within a general class.


## Disks and Partitions
#### Disk partitions
Each disk is divided into one or more (non-overlapping) *partitions*. Each partition is treated by the kernel as a separate device residing under `/dev`.

> The `/proc/partitions` file lists the major and minor device numbers, size and name of each disk partition on the system.


## File Systems
### File-system structure
![[fs-structure.png]]

A file system contains the following parts:
- **Boot block**: always the first block in a file system. It is not used by the file system, but it contains information used to boot the OS. Although only one boot block is used to boot the OS, all file systems have a boot block
- **Superblock**: single block containing parameter information about the file system, including:
	- the size of the i-node table
	- the size of logical blocks in this file system
	- the size of the file system in logical blocks
- I-node table
- Data blocks

## I-nodes
I-nodes are identified numerically by their sequential location in the i-node table. The information maintained in an i-node table includes the following:
- File type
- Owner for the file
- Group for the file
- Access permissions
- Three timestamps:
	- time of last access to the file
	- time of last modification of the file
	- time of last status change
- Number of hard links to the file
- Size of the file in bytes
- Number of blocks actually allocated to the file.
- Pointers to the data blocks of the file

**I-nodes and data block pointers in ext2**

![[inode_blocks.png]]
Under *ext2*, each i-node contains 15 pointers. The first 12 of these pointers point to the location in the file system blocks. 

## The Virtual File System (VFS)
The *VFS* is a kernel feature creating an abstraction layer for file-system operations.

## Single Directory Hierarchy and Mount Points
To list the currently mounted file systems, we can use the command `mount`, with no arguments.

## Mounting and Unmounting File Systems
Three files that contain information about the file systems that are currently mounted or can be mounted:
- A list of the currently mounted file systems can be read from the Linus-specific `/proc/mounts`.
> With the arrival of the per-process mount namespace feature mentioned earlier, each process now has a /proc/PID/mounts file that lists the mount points constituting its mount namespace, and /proc/mounts is just a symbolic link to `/proc/self/mounts`.
- `/etc/mtab` which contains information similar to that in `/proc/mounts`, but sightly more detailed.
- `/etc/fstab` maintained manually by the system administrator.

An example of a line from the `/proc/mounts` file:
`/dev/sda9 /boot ext3 rw 0 0`
The last two mean:
- A number used to control the operation of file-system backups by `dump(8)`.
- A number used to control the order in which `fsck(8)` checks file systems at system boot time.

### Mounting a File System: `mount()`
```c
#include <sys/mount.h>

int mount(const char *source, const char *target, const char *fstype, unsigned long mountflags, const void *data);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.
```
The final argument `data`, is a pointer to a buffer of information whose interpretation depends on the file system.

## Unmounting a File System: `umount()` and `umount2()`
```c
#include <sys/mount.h>

int umount(const char *target);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```
> It is not possible to unmount a file system that is *busy*. Calling the `umount()` when there are open files on the file system, yields the error **EBUSY**.

```c
#include <sys/mount.h>

int umount2(const char *target, int flags);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```
> Refer to the **flags** argument when in need.


## Advanced Mount Features
- Mounting a file system at multiple mount points
- Stacking multiple mounts on the same mount point
- Mount flags that are per-mount options
- Bind Mount
	A **bind mount** allows a directory or a file to be mounted at some other location in the file0system hierarchy. A bind mount is somewhat like a hard link, but differs in two respects:
	- A bind mount can cross file-system mount points
	- It is possible to make a bind mount for a directory
- Recursive bind mounts

## A Virtual Memory File System: tmpfs
The `tmpfs` file system differs from other memory-based file systems is that it is a **virtual** memory file system, which means that it uses not only RAM, but also **swap** space.

```shell
# mount -t tmpfs newtmp /tmp
```
Above is sometimes used to improve the performance of applications that make heavy use of the `/tmp` directory for creating temporary files.

## Obtaining Information About a File System: `statvfs()`
```c
#include <sys/statvfs.h>

int statvfs(const char *pathname, struct statvfs *statvfsbuf);
int fstatvfs(int fd, struct statvfs *statvfsbuf);
Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

`fd` in `fstatvfs()` refers to any file in the file system.
