# Access Control List
ACLs allow file permissions to be specified per user or per group, for an arbitrary number of users and groups.
> In order to be able to create ACLs on file systems, the file system must be mounted with the *mount -o acl* option.

## Overview
An ACL is a series of ACL entries, each of which defines the file permissions for an individual user or group of users.

### ACL entries
Each entry consists of the following parts:
- *tag type*, which indicates whether this entry applies to a user, to a group, or to some other category of user.
- *tag qualifier*, which identifies a specific user or group (i.e., a user ID or group ID).
- *permission set*
`ACL_MASK` (one *tag type*): specifies the maximum permissions that may be granted by *ACL_USER*, *ACL_GROUP_OBJ*, and *ACL_GROUP*.

## Long and Short Text Form for ACLs
Two formats are permitted for these textual representations:
- *Long text form* ACLs contain one ACL entry per line, and may include comments, which are started by # character and continue to be the end-of-line.
- *Short text form* ACLs consist of a sequence of ACL entries separated by colons.

## The `ACL_MASK` Entry and the ACL Group Class
If an ACL contains *ACL_USER* or *ACL_GROUP* entries, then it must contain an *ACL_MASK* entry.

When an ACL has *ACL_MASK* entry:
- all changes to traditional group permissions via *chmod()* change the setting of the *ACL_MASK* entry
- a call to *stat()* returns the *ACL_MASK* permissions in the group permission bits of the *st_mode* field.

## Default ACLs and Files Creation
A default ACL plays n opart in determining the permissions granted when accessing the directory. Instead, its persence or absence determines the ACLs and permissions that are placed on files and subdirectories that are created in the directory.
> When a directory has a default ACL, the process umask doesn't play a part in determining the permissions in the entries of the access ACL of a new file created in that directory.
