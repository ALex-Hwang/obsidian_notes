# FILE I/O BUFFER

## Kernel Buffering
`read()` and `write()` system calls simply copy data between a user-space buffer and a buffer in the kernel *kernel cache*.

The kernel imposes no fixed upper limit on the size of the buffer cache.

### Effect of buffer size on I/O system call performance
The impact of performing file I/O using different buffer sizes can be seen by running the program with different *BUF_SIZE* values.

> When we talk about a vanilla kernel, we mean an unpatched mainline kernel.


## Buffering in the *stdio* Library
### Setting the buffering mode of a *stdio* stream
The `setvbuf()` function controls the form of buffering employed by the *stdio* library.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);
// Returns 0 on success, or nonzero on error
```
> After the stream has been opened, the `setvbuf()` call must be made before calling any other `stdio` function on the stream.

The *buf* and *size* arguments specify the buffer to be used for stream. These arguments may be specified in two ways:
- If the *buf* is non-NULL, then it points to a block of memory of *size* bytes that is to be used as the buffer for *stream*.
- If *buf* is NULL, then the *stdio* library automatically allocates a buffer for use with *stream*.

The *mode* argument specifies the  type of buffering and has one of the following values:
- \_IONBF: Don't buffer I/O. Each *stdio* library call results in an immediate *write()* or *read()* system call.
- \_IOLBF: Employ line-buffered I/O.
- \_IOFBF: Employ fully buffered I/O.

The following code demonstrated the use of *setvbuf()*:
```c
#define BUF_SIZE 1024
static char buf[BUF_SIZE]:

if (setvbuf(stdout, buf, _IOFBF, BUF_SIZE) != 0)
	errExit("setvbuf");
```

The *setbuf()* function is layered on top of *setvbuf()*, and performs a similar task.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);
```
the call `setbuf(fp, buf)` is equivalent to:
`setvbuf(fp, buf, (buf != NULL) ? _IOFBF: _IONBF, BUFSIZE);`
> The `buf` argument is specified either as NULL, for no buffering, or as a pointer to a caller-allocated buffer of BUFSIZE bytes.

The *setbuffer()* function is similar to *setbuf()*, but allows the caller to specify the size of *buf*.
```c
#define _BSD_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>

void setbuffer(FILE *stream, char *buf, size_t size);
```
The call `setbuffer(fp, buf, size)` is equivalent to the following:
`setvbuf(fp, buf, (buf != NULL) ? _IOFBF : _IONBF, size);`


### Flushing a *stdio* buffer
*fflush()* library function flushes the output buffer for the specified stream (flushed to a kernel buffer via *write()*).

```c
#include <stdio.h.>

int fflush(FILE *stream);
// Returns 0 on success, EOF on error
```
If the *stream* is NULL, *fflush()* flushes all *stdio* buffers.


## Controlling Kernel Buffering of File I/O

### Synchronized I/O data integrity and synchronized I/O file integrity
> `Synchronized I/O completion` means "an I/O operation that has either been successfully transferred or diagnosed as unsuccessful."

SUSv3 defines two different types of synchronized I/O completion:

**synchronized I/O data integrity completion**, which is related to ensuring that a file data update transfers **sufficient** information to allow a later retrieval of that data to proceed.

**synchronized I/O file integrity completion**,which is a superset of **synchronized I/O data integrity**.


### System calls for controlling kernel buffering of file I/O
The `fsync()` system call causes the buffered data and all metadata associated with the open file descriptor *fd* to be flushed to disk. Calling `fsync()`  forces the file to the **synchronized I/O file integrity**.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int fsync();
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> An `fsync()` call returns only after the transfer to the disk device (or at least its cache) has completed.

The `fdatasync()` only forces the file to the **synchronized I/O data integrity completion state**.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int fdatasync(int fd);
```

The `sync()` system call cause all kernel buffers containing updated file information to be flushed to disk.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

void sync(void);
```

> A permanently running kernel thread ensures that modified kernel buffers are flushed to disk if they are not explicitly synchronized within 30 seconds.


### Performance impact of **O_SYNC**
Using the **O_SYNC** flag can strongly affect performance.

### The O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC flags
> - `O_SYNC`: requires that any write operations block until **all data and all metadata** have been written to persistent storage.
> - `O_DSYNC`: like O_SYNC, except that there is no requirement to wait for any metadata changes which are not necessary to read the just-written data. In practice, O_DSYNC means that the application does not need to wait until ancillary information (the file modification time, for example) has been written to disk. Using O_DSYNC instead of O_SYNC can often eliminate the need to flush the file inode on a write.
> - `O_RSYNC`: this flag, which only affects read operations, must be used in combination with either O_SYNC or O_DSYNC. It will cause aread() call to block until the data (and maybe metadata) being read has been flushed to disk (if necessary). This flag thus gives the kernel the option of delaying the flushing of data to disk; any number of writes can happen, but data need not be flushed until the application reads it back.

## Summary of I/O Buffering
![[summary_IO_buffering.png]]

## Advising the Kernel About I/O Patterns
The `posix_fadvise()` system call allows a process to inform the kernel about its likely pattern for accessing file data.

```c
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600
#include <fcntl.h>

int posix_fadvise(int fd, off_t offset, off_t len, int advice);
// Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
```

*offset* specifies the starting offset of the region, and *len* specifies the size of the region in bytes. A *len* value of 0 means all bytes from *offset* through to the end of the file.

### Advice pattens:
**POSIX_FADV_NORMAL**
	The process has no special advice to give about access patterns. On Linux, the operation sets the file read-ahead window to the default size (128kB).
**POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL**
	This operation sets the file read-ahead window to twice the default size.
**POSIX_FADV_RANDOM**
	Disable file read-ahead.
**POSIX_FADV_WILLNEDD**
	The process expects to access the specified file region in the near future. The kernel performs read-ahead populate the buffer cache with file data in the range specified by *offset* and *len*.
**POSIX_FADV_DONTNEDD**
	This advises the kernel that it can free the corresponding cache pages (if there are any).
**POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE**
	The process expects to access data in the specified file region once, and then not to reuse it. This hint tells the kernel that it can free the pages after they have been accessed once.

## Bypassing the Buffering Cache: Direct I/O
For most applications, direct I/O can considerably degrade performance. It is intended only for applications with specialized I/O requirements.
We can perform direct I/O either on an individual file or on a block device. To do this, we specify the *O_DIRECT* flag when opening the file or device with `open()`.
> If a file is opened with *O_DIRECT* by one process and opened normally by another process, then there is no coherency between the contents of the buffer and cache and the data read or written via direct I/O.

### Alignment restrictions for direct I/O
Because direct I/O (on both disk devices and files) involves direct access to the disk, we must observe a number of restrictions when performing I/O:
- The data buffer being transferred must be aligned on a memory boundary that is a multiple of the block size.
- The file or device offset at which data transfer commences must be a multiple of the block size.
- The length of the data to be transferred must be a multiple of the block size.

## Mixing Library Functions and System Calls for File I/O
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fileno(FILE *stream);
// Returns file descriptor on success, or -1 on error

FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char *mode);
// Returns (new) file pointer on sucess, or NULL on error
```

Given a stream, `fileno()` returns the corresponding file descriptor. This file descriptor can then be used in the usual way with I/O system calls such as `read()`, `write()`, `dup()`, and `fcntl()`.

The `mode` argument of `fdopen()` is the same as for `fopen()`.

> We must keep **buffering** issues in mind, for I/O system calls transfer data directly to the kernel buffer cache, while the *stdio* library waits until the stream's user-space buffer is full before calling `write()`.

When intermingling I/O system calls and *stdio* functions, we could `fflush()` or use `setvbuf()` or `setbuf()` to disable buffering.
