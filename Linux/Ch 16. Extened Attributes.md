# Extended Attributes
EAs, which allow arbitrary metadata, in the form of name-value pairs, to be associated with file i-nodes.

## Overview

### EA namespaces
Four values are supported for *namespace*:
- *User* EAs may be manipulated by unprivileged processes, subject to file permission checks. In order to associate *user* EAs with a file on arbitrary file systems, the underlying file system must be mounted with the *user_xattr* option.
- *Trusted* EAs are like *user* EAs  in that they can be manipulated by user processes. The diff is that *Trusted* is that a process must be privileged(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) in order to manipulate *trusted* EAs.
- *System* EAs are used by the kernel to associate system objects within a file. Currently, the only supported object type is an access control list.
- *Security* EAs are used to store file security labels for operating system security modules, and to associate capabilities with executable files.

### Creating and viewing EAs from the shell
We can use *setfattr(1)* and *getfatrr(1)* to set and view the EAs on a file.
> By default, *getfattr* lists only the values of *user* EAs.

## Extended Attribute implementation Details

### Restrictions on *user* extended attributes
It is only possible to place *user* EAs on files and directories. Furthermore, it is not possible for an unprivileged process to place a *user* EA on a directory owned by another user if the sticky bit is set on the directory.
