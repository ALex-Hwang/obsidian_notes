# Extended Attributes
EAs, which allow arbitrary metadata, in the form of name-value pairs, to be associated with file i-nodes.

## Overview

### EA namespaces
Four values are supported for *namespace*:
- *User* EAs may be manipulated by unprivileged processes, subject to file permission checks. In order to associate *user* EAs with a file on arbitrary file systems, the underlying file system must be mounted with the *user_xattr* option.
- *Trusted* EAs are like *user* EAs  in that they can be manipulated by user processes. The diff is that *Trusted* is that a process must be privileged(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) in order to manipulate *trusted* EAs.
