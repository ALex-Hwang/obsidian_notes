# System and Process Information
The primary focus of the chapter is a discussion of the `/proc` file system. We also describe the *uname()* system call, which is used to retrieve various system identifiers.

## The /proc File System
The `/proc` file system is virtual because the files and subdirectories that it contains don't reside on a disk.

### Obtaining Information About a Process: /proc/PID
`/proc/PID`

The fact that the contents of this file have changed over time raises a general point about the use of `/proc` files: when these files consist of multiple entries, we should parse them defensively -in this case, looking for a match on a line containing a particular string.

**The /proc/PID/fd directory**
The `/proc/PID/fd` directory contains one symbolic link for each file descriptor that the process has open.

**Threads: The /proc/PID/task directory**
`/proc/PID/task/TID`

### Accessing /proc Files
Files under `/proc` are often accessed using shell scripts.
Some restrictions apply when accessing these files:
- Some `/proc` files are read-only.
- Some `/proc` files can be read only by the file owner.
- Other than the files in the `/proc/PID` sub-directories, most files under `/proc` are owned by *root*, and the files that are modifiable can be modified only by root.

#### Accessing files in /proc/PID
If we determine that a particular /proc/PID directory exists, then we need to cleanly handle the possibility that the process terminated.
