# File Attributes

## Retrieving File information: `stat()`
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>

int stat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf);
int lstat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf);
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *statbuf);
// All return 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

`lstat()` is similar to `stat()`, except that if the named file is a symbolic link, information about the link itself is returned.

**File timestamps**
The *st_atime*, *st_mtime*, and *st_ctime* fields contain, respectively, the times of last file access, last file modification, and last status change.

## File Timestamps
![[file_timestamp.png]]

### Changing File Timestamps with `utime()` and `utimes()`
Programs such as `tar` and `unzip` use these system calls to reset file timestamps when unpacking an archive.

```c
#include <utime.h>

int utime(const char *pathname, const struct utimbuf *buf);

```

*utimbuf* structure:
```c
struct utimbuf {
	time_t actime;
	time_t modtime;
};
```

Two different cases determine how `utime()` works:
- If *buf* is specified as *NULL*, then both the last access and the last modification times are set to the current time. In this case, either the [[Ch9. Process Credentials#Effective User ID an Effective Group ID|effective user ID]] of the process must match the file's user ID, the process must have write permission on the file, or the process must be privileged.
- If *buf* is specified as pointer to a *utimbuf* structure, then the last file access and modification times are updated using the corresponding fields of this structure. In this case, the effective user ID of the process must match the file's user ID (**having write permission on the file is not sufficient**) or the caller must be privileged.
 
> To change just one of the file timestamps, we first use `stat()` to retrieve both the times, and use one of these to initialize the *utimbuf* structure.


```c
#include <sys/time.h>

int utimes(const char *pathname, const struct timeval tv[2]);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> The most difference between `utime()` and `utimes()` is that `utimes()` allows time values to be specified with microsecond accuracy.

The new file access time is specified in *tv[0]*, and the new modification time is specified in *tv[1]*.

```c
#include <sys/time.h>

int futimes(int fd, const struct timeval tv[2]);
int lutimes(const char *pathname, const struct timeval tv[2]);
// Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

The difference between `lutimes()` and `utimes()` is that when a symbolic link is passed to `lutimes()`, the link is not dereferenced, the timestamps of the link itself is changed.

## Changing File Timestamps with `utimensat()` and `futimens()`

The advantages of them are below:
- nanosecond accuracy provided
- possible to set the timestamps independently
- possible to set either the timestamps to the current time

```c
#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 700
#include <sys/stat.h>

int utimensat(int dirfd, const char *pathname, const struct timespec times[2], int flags);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

```c
struct timespec {
	time_t tv_sec, // Seconds
	long tv_nsec, // Nanoseconds
};
```

> To set one of the timestamps to the current time, we specify the special value `UTIME_NOW` in the corresponding `tv_nsec` field. 
> To leave one of the timestamps unchanged, we specify the special value `UTIME_OMIT` in the corresponding `tv_nsec` field.


```c
#include _GNU_SOURCE
#include <sys/stat.h>

int futimens(int fd, const struct timespec times[2]);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

## File Ownership
### Ownership of New Files
When a new file is created, its user ID is taken from the effective user ID of the program. The group ID of the new file may taken from either the effective group ID of the process, or the group ID of the parent directory.
![[rules_newly_created.png]]

### Changing File Ownership: `chown()`, `fchown()`, and `lchown()`
which change the owner and group of a file.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int chown(const char *pathname, uid_t owner, gid_t group);

#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500
#include <unistd.h>

int lchown(const char *pathname, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
int fchown(int fd, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
// All return 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> `lchown()` does the same with `chown()` except that if **pathname** is a symbolic link, ownership of the link file is changed.

To change only one of the IDs, we can specify `-1` for the other argument to leave that ID unchanged.
