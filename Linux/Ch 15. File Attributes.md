# File Attributes

## Retrieving File information: `stat()`
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>

int stat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf);
int lstat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf);
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *statbuf);
// All return 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

`lstat()` is similar to `stat()`, except that if the named file is a symbolic link, information about the link itself is returned.

**File timestamps**
The *st_atime*, *st_mtime*, and *st_ctime* fields contain, respectively, the times of last file access, last file modification, and last status change.

## File Timestamps

### Changing File Timestamps with `utime()` and `utimes()`
Programs such as `tar` and `unzip` use these system calls to reset file timestamps when unpacking an archive.

```c
#include <utime.h>

int utime(const char *pathname, const struct utimbuf *buf);

```

*utimbuf* structure:
```c
struct utimbuf {
	time_t actime;
	time_t modtime;
};
```

Two different cases determine how `utime()` works:
- If *buf* is specified as *NULL*, then both the last access and the last modification times are set to the current time. In this case, either the [[Ch9. Process Credentials#Effective User ID an Effective Group ID|effective user ID]] of the process must match the file's user ID, the process must have write permission on the file, or the process must be privileged.
- If *buf* is specified as pointer to a *utimbuf* structure, then the last file access and modification times are updated using the corresponding fields of this structure. In this case, the effective user ID of the process must match the file's user ID (**having write permission on the file is not sufficient**) or the caller must be privileged.
 
> To change just one of the file timestamps, we first use `stat()` to retrieve both the times, and use one of these to initialize the *utimbuf* structure.
