# Ch10. TIME
 Within a program, we may be interested in two kinds of time:
 - Real time
 - Process time

In this chapter, we look at system calls for dealing with both sorts of time, and library functions for converting between human-readable and internal representations of time.

## Calendar Time
UNIX systems represent time internally as a measure of seconds since the Epoch (1970.01.01). Calendar time is stored in variables of type *time_t*, an integer type specified by SUSv3.
