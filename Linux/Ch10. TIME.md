# Ch10. TIME
 Within a program, we may be interested in two kinds of time:
 - Real time
 - Process time

In this chapter, we look at system calls for dealing with both sorts of time, and library functions for converting between human-readable and internal representations of time.

## Calendar Time
UNIX systems represent time internally as a measure of seconds since the Epoch (1970.01.01). Calendar time is stored in variables of type *time_t*, an integer type specified by SUSv3.

```c
#include <sys/time.h>

int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.
```

The *tv* argument is a pointer to a structure of the following form:
```c
struct timeval {
	time_t tv_sec; // Secs since 00:00:00, 1 Jan 1970 UTC
	suseconds_t tv_usec; 
}
```

The *time()* system call returns the number of seconds since the Epoch (the same value that *gettimeofday(*)* returns in the *tv_sec* field of its *tv* argument).

```c
#include <time.h>

time_t time(time_t *timep);
// Returns number of seconds since the Epoch, or -1 on error.
```

> The existence of `time()` is now redundant.

## Time Conversion Functions

### Converting *time_t* to Printable Form

The `ctime()` function provides a simple method of converting a `time_t` value into printable form.

```c
#include <time.h>

char *ctime(const time_t *timep);
// Returns pointer to statically allocated string terminated by newline and \0 on success, or NULL on error.
```

### Converting Between *time_t* and Broken-Down Time
```c
#include <time.h>

struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *timep);
struct tm *localtime(const time_t *timep);
// Both return a pointer to a statically allocated broekn-down time structure on success, or NULL on error.
```

> `gmtime()` converts a calendar time into a broken-down time corresponding to UTC, while `localtime()` takes into account timezone .


The `tm` struct:
```c
struct tm {
	int tm_sec; // Seconds (0-60)
	int tm_min;
	int tm_hour;
	int tm_mday;
	int tm_mon;
	int tm_year;
	int tm_wday;
	int tm_yday;
	int tm_isdst;
};
```

```c
#include <time.h>

time_t mktime(struct tm *timeptr);
// Returns seconds since the Epoch corresponding to timeptr on success, or (time_t -1) on error
```

### Converting Between Broken-down Time and Printable Form

#### Converting from broken-down time to printable form
```c
#include <time.h>

char *asctime(const struct tm *timeptr);
// Returns pointer to statically allocated string terminated by newline and \0 on success, or NULL on error.
```

> By contrast with `ctime()`, local timezone settings have no effect on `asctime()`.

The `strftime()` function provides us with more precise control when converting a broken-down time into printable form.
```c
#include <time.h>

size_t strtime(char *outstr, size_t maxsize, const char *format, const struct tm *timeptr);
// Returns number of bytes placed in outstr (excluding terminating null byte) on success, or 0 on error
```

#### Converting from printable form to broken-down time
The *strptime()* function is the converse of *strftime()*. It converts a date-plus-time string to a broken-down time.
```c
