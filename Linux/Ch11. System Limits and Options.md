# System Limits and Options
The C programming language standards and SUSv3 provide two principal avenues for an application to obtain such information:
- Some limits and options can be determined at compile time. E.g. the maximum value of an *int*.
- *sysconf()*, *pathconf()*, *fpathconf()*

## System Limits
SUSv3 requires that all implementation support a *minimum value*  for the limit. They are constant in <limits.h> with a name prefixed by the string \__POSIX_XXX_MAX.

> The constants are the minimum upper value of each limit.

Sometimes we want to exceed the limits. For this reason, it is usually preferable to determine the limit on a particular system using <limits.h>, *sysconf()*, *pathconf()*. Each limit has the same name with in <limits.h>, but without a *POSIX* prefix.

SUSv3 divides the limits into three categories:
- runtime invariant values
- pathname variable values
- runtime increasable value

### Runtime invariant values (possibly indeterminate)
A runtime invariant value is a limit whose value, if defined in <limits.h>, is fixed for the implementation. However, the value may be indeterminate, and hence omitted from <limits.h>. In this case, an application can use *sysconf()* to determine the value at run time.

### Pathname variable values
A limit can vary depending on the pathname, an application can determine its value using *pathconf()*, or *fpathconf()*.

```c
lim = pathconf(directory_path, _PC_NAME_MAX);
```

### Runtime increasable values
A runtime increasable value is a limit that has a fixed minimum value for a particular implementation, and all systems running the implementation will provide at least this minimum value.

### Determining limits ans options from the shell
From the shell, we can use the *getconf* command to obtain the limits and options implemented by a particular UNIX implementation.
```shell
$ getconf ARG_MAX
```

## Retrieving System Limits (and Options) at Run Time
The *sysconf()* function allows an application to obtain the values of system limits at run time.
```c
#include <unistd.h>

long sysconf(int name);
// Returns value of limit specified by name, or -1 if limit is indeterminate or an error occurred
```

> The `name` argument is one of the \_SC_* constants defined in <unistd.h>.

> `sysconf()` will returns -1 if a limit cannot be determined or an error occurred. We need `errno` to distinguish.

> SUSv3 requires that the values returned by `sysconf()` for a particular limit be constant for the lifetime of the calling process.


## Retrieving File-Related Limits (and Options) at Run Time
The *pathconf()* and *fpathconf()* functions allow an application to obtain the values of file-related limits at run time.
```c
#inlcude <unistd.h>

long pathconf(const char *pathname, int name);
long fpathconf(int fd, int name);
// Both return vlaue of limit specified by name, or -1 if limit is indeterminate of an error occurred.
```

> Unlike `sysconf()`, SUSv3 doesn't require that the values returned by `pathconf()` and `fpathconf()` remain constant over the lifetime of a process.

## Indeterminate Limits
When we find that some system limit is not defined by an implementation limit constant, and that `sysconf()` or `pathconf()` informs us that the limit is indeterminate, we can employ the following strategies.

- Use the minimum limit value specified by SUSv3.
- To ignore the checking of limits, and instead perform the relevant system or library function.
- We can write our own program or function to either deduce or estimate the limit.
- We can employ a toll such as GNU *Autoconf*, an extensible tool that can determine the existence and settings of various system features and limits.
