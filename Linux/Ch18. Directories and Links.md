# Directories and Links

## Directories and (Hard) Links
A directory is stored in the file system in a similar way to a regular file, except:
- A directory is marked with a different file type in its i-node entry.
- A directory is a file with a special organization. Essentially, it is a table consisting of filenames and i-node numbers.

> The i-node number starts at 1, rather than 0, because 0 in the i-node field indicates that the entry is unused. I-node 1 is used to record bad blocks in the file system.

We can use `ln` command to create hard links.
> The `rm` command removes a filename from a directory list, decrements the link count of the corresponding i-node by 1, and, if the link count thereby falls to 0, deallocates the i-node and the data block.

Hard links have two limitations, both of which can be circumvented by the use of symbolic links:
- A hard link must reside on the same file system as the file to which it refers.
- A hard link can't be made to a directory. This prevents the creation of circular links, which would confuse many system programs.

## Symbolic (Soft) Links
A *symbolic link*, is a special file type whose data is the name of another file.

### File Permissions and ownership for symbolic links
The ownership of a symbolic link is relevant only when the link itself is being removed or renamed in a directory with the sticky permission bit set.

## Creating and Removing (Hard) Links: `link()` and `unlik()`
```c
#include <unistd.h>

int link(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> If *newpath* already exists, it is not overwritten; instead an error results.

> `link()` does not dereference a symbolic link.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int unlink(const char *pathname);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> We can use `unlink()` to remove a directory. And it does not dereference symbolic links.

### An open file is deleted only when all file descriptors are closed.
If the last link to a file is removed and any processes hold open descriptors referring to the file, the file won't actually be deleted until all of the descriptors are closed.


## Changing he Name of a File: `rename()`
It can be used both to rename a file and to move it into another directory on the same file system.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int rename(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.
```

## Working with Symbolic Links: `symlink()` and `readlink()`
```c
#include <unistd.h>

int symlink(const char *filepath, const char *linkpath);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> The file named in filepath doesn't need to exist at the call.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t readlink(const char *pathname, char *buffer, ssize_t bufsiz);
// Returns number of bytes placed in buffer on success, or -1 on error.
```

## Creating and Removing Directories: `mkdir()` and `rmdir()`
```c
#include <sys/stat.h>

int mkdir(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error```

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int rmdir(const char *pathname);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error
```

> The directory must be empty.

## Removing a File or Directory: `remove()`
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int remove(const char *pathname);
// Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.
```

> If *pathname* is a file, `remove()` calls `unlink()`; if *pathname* is a directory, `remove()` calls `rmdir()`.

## Reading Directories: `opendif()`and `readdir()`

```c
#include <dirent.h>

DIR *opendir(const char *dirpath);
// Returns directory stream handle, or NULL on error
```
```c
#include <dirent.h>

DIR *fdopendir(int fd);
// Returns directory stream handle, or NULL on error
```
```c
#include <dirent.h>

struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);
// Returns pointer to a statically allocated structure describing next directory entry, or NULL on end-of-directory on error
```
**The dirent structure**
```c
struct dirent {
	ino_t d_ino; // File i-node number
	char d_name[]; // Null-terminated name of file
}
```

> On end-of-directory or error, `readdir()` returns NULL, in the latter case setting `errno`to indicate the error.

All filenames that have been neither added or removed since the last call (`readdir()` or `rewinddir()`) are guaranteed to be returned.
